# Final-Project---Movie-Recommendation-Website
A movie recommendation website built using Python, scikit-learn, Flask, jQuery, and Bootstrap

I started with the MovieLens 1M dataset, and put together a recommendation system that focuses on movie genre. 
In the future, I will be applying different ML models to the data to generate additional recommendation features, and move the data into a SQL database so the website can be hosted online. 

The algorithm is partially housed in the engine.py file, and the rest of the code is housed in the app.py app routes.
